# Minimizing the least squares error with quadratic regularization : but why ???
# In this Notebook,
.1 we show that minimizing the least squares error in a regression context is related to a Gaussian assumption of the error distribution
.1 we also show that $L2$ regularization appears under an assumption of Gaussian distribution of the parameters and a Baysian treatment
.1 We show that maximizing the posterior distribution is equivalent to minimizing the regularized sum-of-squares error function with a quadratic regularizer
