Minimizing the least squares error
===============
# In this Notebook, 
1. we show that minimizing the least squares error in a regression context is related to a Gaussian assumption of the error distribution
2. we also show that $L2$ regularization appears under an assumption of Gaussian distribution of the parameters and a Baysian treatment
3. We show that maximizing the posterior distribution is equivalent to minimizing the regularized sum-of-squares error function  with a quadratic regularizer
